# Battleheim 

Battleheim is a class-based roguelite with a norse mythology theme. It combines the ARPG and roguelite genres to provide rewarding gameplay that is sure to keep you hooked. 

Use three exciting abilities to fight big packs of enemies as you move through rooms and floors, getting stronger and stronger as you fight to become the champion of the Norse gods.

The purpose of the project is about developing a game demo starting with an idea and working on it through a concept description, a target group analysis, a defined tech platform and a business plan.
